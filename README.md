# installPuppetEnterprise.sh
Script to automate the installation of a Puppet Enterprise server<br>
Added a few improvements to the original/official installations script but, in esence it is pretty much the same.<br>
When it comes to installing a Puppet Server, grab a warm beverage you like, keep calm and wait for the process to finish as it may take from 30 min to 2 hours, depending on a lot of factors beyond our control...<b>

# in case of errors during the installation process...
Unless you cannot fix them yourself (i.e. your disk ran out of space, wrong permissions, etc) please raise a support ticket with Puppet as I do not provide support once the Puppet Enterprise installer kicks in.
